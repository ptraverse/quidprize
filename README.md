quidprize

cash raffles sponsored by page owners which use claimed web redirects as entries in the raffles.

eg. Pepsi sponsors a raffle for $100 that uses any redirect to pepsi.com via quidprize which gives pepsi 
a set of links like quid.ly/pepsi/123. Then someguy@hotmail.com registers his email with that link and
then spams his friends on behalf of pepsi, and everytime the link gets hit by a unique IP he gets an
entry into the $100 draw. When he wins quidprize notifies both parties and everyone wins.
